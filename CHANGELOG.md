## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **CLI Enhancements**: Major improvements to the command-line interface
  - **Intelligent Autocomplete System**:
    - Nested command completion with TAB key
    - Argument suggestions for boolean commands (`true`/`false`)
    - Variable path suggestions for `subscribe` command (14 common paths from example project)
    - Dynamic subscription ID completions for `unsubscribe` command
    - Object field suggestions for `write_object` (Counter=, Ready=)
  - **Subscription Shortcut Commands**: Quick access to example project variables
    - `sub_counter` - Subscribe to cycle-based counter (`GLOBAL.gMyIntCounter`)
    - `sub_toggle` - Subscribe to cycle-based toggle (`GLOBAL.gMyBoolToogle`)
    - `sub_timed_counter` - Subscribe to time-based counter (`GLOBAL.gTimedIntCounter`)
    - `sub_timed_toggle` - Subscribe to time-based toggle (`GLOBAL.gTimedBoolToogle`)
    - `sub_all` - Subscribe to all 4 counters/toggles simultaneously
  - **Control Commands**: Interactive control for example project toggles and timers
    - `enable_counter`, `enable_toggle`, `enable_timed_counter`, `enable_timed_toggle` - Control enable flags
    - `read_counters` - Read all counter and toggle values at once
    - `reset_counters` - Reset all counters and toggles to initial values
    - `read_status` - Display status of all enable flags
    - `set_period <seconds>` - Configure cycle period for timed operations (1-3600s)
    - `read_period` - Display current cycle period
  - **Enhanced Subscription Display**:
    - `list_subs` now shows last received value, time since last update, and notification count
    - Statistics tracking for each subscription (value, timestamp, count)
    - Human-readable time formatting (ms/s/m/h)
    - Multi-line display format for better readability
- **Example TwinCAT Project**: Added complete working TwinCAT 3 project
  - Location: `example/example/`
  - Includes cycle-based and time-based counters and toggles
  - Configurable timer period via ADS
  - Enable/disable flags for all automatic behaviors
  - Demonstrates real-time subscriptions and control operations
  - 14 global variables available for testing (basic types, arrays, structs)

### Changed
- **Flexible boolean/integer coercion in `WriteValue`**:
  - `ADST_BIT` (BOOL) now accepts integer `0` or `1` in addition to `bool`
  - All integer and float types (`INT8`–`UINT64`, `REAL32`/`REAL64`) now accept `bool` (`true` → `1`, `false` → `0`)
- Updated CLI read/write commands to use example project variables
  - `read_value`/`write_value` now use `GLOBAL.gMyInt`
  - `read_bool`/`write_bool` now use `GLOBAL.gMyBool`
  - `read_object`/`write_object` now use `GLOBAL.gMyDUT` (simplified to Counter/Ready fields)
  - `read_array`/`write_array` now use `GLOBAL.gIntArray` (changed from 10 to 5 elements for usability)
  - `subscribe` default path changed to `GLOBAL.gMyBoolToogle`
- **Renamed state commands** for consistency: `toConfig`/`toRun` → `set_state config`/`set_state run`
- Enhanced CLI help command with detailed command descriptions and usage examples
- Improved subscription callback to track statistics automatically

### Fixed
- Removed redundant newline in help command output (go vet warning)
- **Reconnection loop after `set_state config/run`**: Two races in the reconnect path caused an infinite loop when TwinCAT left Run mode
  - Stale `receive()` goroutine was closing the newly established connection via its deferred `conn.Close()`, immediately dropping it and triggering another reconnect cycle
  - Stale `receive()` goroutine was firing `OnConnectionLost` even after `c.conn` had already been replaced by a successful reconnect, stacking reconnect loops
  - `Connect()` now resets the receive buffer before starting a new session to prevent stale packet framing from bleeding into the new connection
- **`OnConnectionLost` no longer fires on TC state transitions**: State changes (Run→Config, Config→Run) are reported exclusively via `OnStateChange`; `OnConnectionLost` is reserved for genuine connection drops (TCP EOF, poll timeouts). This allows the client to stay connected and operational while TwinCAT is in Config mode.
